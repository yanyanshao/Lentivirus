### Get sequence from a fasta file (use for FASTA file with a single sequence)

### function to calculate gc content

### get sequence based on given corrdinates, from an input fasta file

### range overlap function

### cumulative list of ranges coverage

    for start, stop in (list_ranges):
        sum += stop-start+1
